# Recursion
## Because I'm fairly convinced it's just a party trick
### Don't @ me

## What your basic recursion function needs
1. It needs a termination condition

```javascript

if (we reach our fail-safe) {return};

```

2. Base case

```javascript

if (we reach success) {yay! we are done!};

```

3. The actual recursion

```javascript

return x * factorial(x - 1);

```
